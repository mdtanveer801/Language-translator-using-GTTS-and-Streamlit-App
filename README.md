# Language-translator-using-GTTS-and-Streamlit-App
This Python script creates a Streamlit app for text translation and text-to-speech. It loads language data from a CSV file, uses the translate package for translation, and gTTS for generating speech. Users can input text, choose a language, get the translation, listen to it, and download the audio file.
